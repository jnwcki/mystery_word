Hangman-like letter guessing game

This was my third assignment during my first week at the Iron Yard. The objective was to learn how to
open text files and import their contents into python collections. It picks a word from the dictionary file
on an OSX computer and allows the user to guess its letters.

The hard mode of the assignment added the ability to choose a difficulty level and the option to play again.
